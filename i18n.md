# Locale Django:

install gettext:
```
brew install gettext
```
- config gettext:
 This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides the BSD gettext library & some software gets confused if both are in the library path.

- gettext
If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/gettext/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/gettext/include

- **create locale**:
```
python manage.py makemessages -l <LANGUAGE_CODE>
```

- **compile files**:
```
python manage.py compilemessages
```

----------------------------------
## config setting django:

```
LOCALE_PATH = (
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'locale'),
 )
```
